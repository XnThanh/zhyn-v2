# Prompt: What possible commands do you accept? Give me the different commands available.
# response:

As an AI, I don't have a fixed, rigid list of "commands" in the way a computer program or a specific software application might. Instead, I understand and process natural language, allowing me to respond to a wide variety of requests.

Think of my "commands" more as **categories of tasks or types of requests** you can make. The specific wording you use can vary greatly.

Here are the main categories of actions I can perform, which you can consider as different "commands" available:

1.  **Answer Questions:**
    *   "What is...?"
    *   "How does... work?"
    *   "Explain..."

    *   "When was...?"

    *   "Create a list of..."
    *   "Develop a [plan/outline] for..."

3.  **Summarize & Condense:**
    *   "Summarize this text/article."
    *   "Give me the main points of..."
    *   "Condense this information into [X] words."

4.  **Elaborate & Expand:**
    *   "Elaborate on this point."
    *   "Expand on this idea."
    *   "Tell me more about..."

5.  **Rewrite & Paraphrase:**
    *   "Rewrite this paragraph in a [different tone/style]."
    *   "Rephrase this sentence."
    *   "Make this sound more [formal/casual/professional]."

6.  **Translate Languages:**
    *   "Translate [phrase] to [language]."
    *   "How do you say [word] in [language]?"

7.  **Solve Problems & Perform Calculations:**
    *   "Calculate [math problem]."
    *   "Solve this equation."
    *   "Help me debug this [code snippet]."
    *   "Suggest solutions for [a problem]."

8.  **Provide Instructions & Procedures:**
    *   "Give me instructions on how to..."
    *   "Provide a step-by-step guide for..."
    *   "What are the steps to accomplish X?"

9.  **Brainstorm & Generate Ideas:**
    *   "Brainstorm ideas for [a project/gift/topic]."
    *   "Give me creative suggestions for..."

10. **Compare & Contrast:**
    *   "Compare and contrast [X] and [Y]."
    *   "What are the differences between X and Y?"

11. **Adopt a Persona or Role-play:**

    *   "What is the sentiment of this review?"

Essentially, if you can phrase it as a question or a directive in natural language, I will do my best to understand and respond. Just tell me what you need!
