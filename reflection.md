# Reflection

### General

Concepts specification was a bit hard to wrap my head around at first, and when trying to come up with the concept spec for my app, it took a lot of brainstorming with a TA and thinking and revising it on my own to come up with a proper concept spec. However, once that process was complete, implementing the concepts following those specs made coding the rest of the app a lot easier, as everything just clicked into place. 

The visual design study was also quite interesting, as it made me look around for design inspiration, which had a really big effect on my final design. I already had most of my UI elements coded up before the visual design study, but I changed the design completely after the visual design study, and I am a lot happier with the new design (see details in Design Doc).

In general, I learned a lot about concepts and coding a fullstack project from scratch. 

### Mistakes

I tend to get to held up on the frontend UI a lot of time, which was why I started designing the UI before we needed to do the visual design study. Which afterwards, I scraped everything and remade the UI, which is not very time-efficient.

### Agentic Coding

Agentic coding really accelerated the process of building this app. I've done some web app projects on my own before without agentic coding, and it would take a very long time to do it because how much time it took to write the HTML, CSS, and debug CSS alignment issues. With AI, I can iterate so much faster. However, I do feel like I sometimes rely on/trust it too much, and my proficiency in CSS didn't improve much through this project, since I relied on AI a lot to do the coding for me. While I did oftentimes go in to fix the code and my own changes, I felt like I don't have as deep of an understanding of my codebase compared to the past when I wrote it without AI. I think this is such an interesting topic to discuss because while there are so many benefits to using AI in code, most notably speed of iteration, there are also many downsides to it, especially as students who are still building our fundamentals in coding. I feel like it can possibly result in a weaker fundamental which prevents future progress, since you can't build a skyscraper on a weak foundation.
