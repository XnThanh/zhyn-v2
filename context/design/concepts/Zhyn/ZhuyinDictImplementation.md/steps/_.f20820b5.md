# Documentation

Every concept should have inline documentation and commenting:

* The concept itself should be paired with its purpose.
* The state should be described next to any types.
* Any testing should be guided by the principle.
* Each action should state the requirements and effects, and tests should check that both work against variations.

**concept** ZhuyinDictionary
**purpose** tracks the Zhuyin Representation of Characters
**principle** each generate creates a random sentence with Chinese characters suitable to User level

**state**
a set of Characters with
  a ZhuyinRep

**actions**
register (Character, ZhuyinRep)
  requires Character doesn't already exist
  effect add Character and associate with that ZhuyinRep

unregister (Character, ZhuyinRep)
  requires Character already exist
  effect remove Character and corresponding ZhuyinRep

getAnswer (Character): (ZhuyinRep)
  effects returns the ZhuyinRep associated with the Character

lookupZhuyin (ZhuyinRep): (characters: Character\[])
effects Returns a list of all Characters whose Zhuyin representation matches ZhuyinRep. The pattern can be a full Zhuyin string, a partial prefix, or even support wildcards for more advanced search. This allows users to find all characters with a specific pronunciation.
