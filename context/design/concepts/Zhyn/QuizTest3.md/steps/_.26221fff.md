# Test implementation

While testing, use the `testDb` function, which returns a tuple of the database and client so that you can close it.

```typescript
import { testDb } from "@utils/database.ts";

Deno.test("...", async () => {
  const [db, client] = await testDb();

  // ... tests

  await client.close();
});
```

The database is already automatically dropped before every test file using the `Deno.test.beforeAll` hook: do not include any additional manipulation of the database for this purpose.

Use the Deno.test framework, splitting by appropriate test steps and describing each behavior. Import helpers from:

```typescript
import { assertEquals } from "jsr:@std/assert"; // or any other utility from the library
```

**princple**

1. system makes new quiz with 1 second timer (for testing feasibility)
2. system register 3 questions
3. user correctly answers question 1
4. user incorrectly answers question 2
5. timer runs out before user finishes question 3, system gets speed and accuracy of quiz

**register**\
add new question
add new question with duplicate character (ok)

**startQuestion**\
start question with valid question id
start question that already started
start question with invalid question id

**submitAnswer**\
submit correct answer
submit incorrect answer
submit with invalid question id
submit question that has not started

**getSpeed**\
valid question id, speed available
valid question id, speed not available
invalid question id

**getAccuracy**\
valid question id, accuracy available
valid question id, accuracy not available
invalid question id
