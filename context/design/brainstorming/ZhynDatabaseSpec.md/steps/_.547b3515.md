# Documentation

Every concept should have inline documentation and commenting:

* The concept itself should be paired with its purpose.
* The state should be described next to any types.
* Any testing should be guided by the principle.
* Each action should state the requirements and effects, and tests should check that both work against variations.

\<concept\_spec>

concept Database

purpose
generate sentences tailored to a User's level

principle
Characters and their ZhuyinRep are added and assigned to one or more Levels (by admin, not user);
User action can generate a random sentence with Chinese characters suitable to their level using LLM;

state
a set of Levels with\
a set of Characters

```
a set of Characters with  
    a ZhuyinRep

invariants
    every Character has a unique ZhuyinRep
    every level has a unique Character set

note (to self, and to grader)
    in uncommon instances, a single Chinese Character may have more than one ZhuyinRep. 
    These are known as polyphonic characters. The scope of this project will assume one ZhuyinRep per Character.
```

actions\
register (Character, ZhuyinRep)\
requires Character doesn't already exist\
effect add Character and associate with that ZhuyinRep

```
addCharacter (Character, Level)  
    requires Character not already in Level, Character exists and has a ZhuyinRep  
    effect associate Character to Level

removeCharacter (Character, Level)  
    requires Character in Level  
    effect remove Character from Level

generateSentence (Level, topic: String): (sentences: String[])  
    effect Get Characters in Level; Use LLM to generate a set of sentences on given topic using only characters in that Level. 
        LLM takes a list of characters in Level and a topic. Generates valid sentences and Return sentences.

getAnswer (Character): (ZhuyinRep)  
    effect returns the ZhuyinRep associated with the Character
```
